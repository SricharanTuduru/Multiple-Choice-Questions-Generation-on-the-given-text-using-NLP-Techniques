# Multiple-Choice-Questions-Generation-on-the-given-text-using-NLP-Techniques

This project aims to develop a solution for automatically generating objective questions with multiple correct answers based on a given chapter or article. The goal is to create an engaging assessment tool that can aid educators in testing their students' understanding and encouraging them to explore different perspectives.

The key steps involved in the solution methodology are:

Summarization: Perform either extractive or abstractive summarization to extract the important information from the given text.
Paraphrasing: If using extractive summarization, paraphrase the sentences to introduce variation.
Keyword Extraction: Extract the relevant keywords from the processed text using techniques like YAKE, TopicRank, KeyBERT, or Multi-partitite algorithm.
Question Generation: Generate multiple-choice questions based on the extracted keywords using a fine-tuned model.
Distractor Generation: Generate incorrect answer choices (distractors) using resources like WordNet, sense2vec, or word2vec.
Output: Present the final result, which includes the questions, correct answers, and distractors.
The project showcases a workflow for developing a solution to this complex problem, even though a full-fledged model is not yet implemented. The future scope suggests the development of a more robust and accurate model for this task.

This project demonstrates your understanding of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and your ability to tackle a challenging problem in the field of educational assessment. It could be a valuable contribution to your GitHub portfolio, showcasing your problem-solving skills and your approach to developing solutions for real-world problems.
